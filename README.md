# Task 4 – Feature Encoding & Scaling

## Objective

Apply feature encoding and scaling techniques on the Adult Income Dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.

## Dataset

* Adult Income Dataset (`adult.csv`)

## Steps Performed

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Identified numerical and categorical features
* Applied Label Encoding on the target column (`income`)
* Applied One-Hot Encoding on unordered categorical features
* Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
* Compared data before and after scaling
* Saved the processed dataset

## Concepts Covered

* Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding
* Feature Engineering
* Standardization (Scaling)
* Impact of scaling on ML algorithms

## Files

* `data/adult.csv` – Original dataset
* `data/processed_adult.csv` – Preprocessed dataset
* `notebook/task4_feature_encoding_scaling.ipynb` – Notebook with full implementation
